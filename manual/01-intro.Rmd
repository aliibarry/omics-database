# Data Processing {#data}

## Preparation

To implement this app, you will need three types of data:

* Count tables in “./data/CountTables/” folder
* Column Data (abbrev: colData) in “./data/ColDatas/” folder
+ This contains the info about each sample
+ The colnames of colData should include ‘Population’, ‘Timepoint’, ‘Sex’ , ‘Dataset’ and ‘Species’
+ If your experiment does not separate those samples based on any of those parameters, you will need to create a column that specifies this.
+ E.g. if your samples are of mixed sex, you can creates a ‘Sex’ column containing ‘mixed’ for all samples
