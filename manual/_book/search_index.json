Here we will describe how to build a Shiny app for sequencing data using the code base described in CITE PAPER HERE. A working example of this app is hosted at https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/ and the code base is provided at https://github.com/aliibarry/omics-database. "],["data.html", "Chapter 2 Data Processing 2.1 Preparation 2.2 Building an SQL database", " Chapter 2 Data Processing 2.1 Preparation To implement this app, you will need three types of data: Count tables in “./data/CountTables/” folder Column Data (abbrev: colData) in “./data/ColDatas/” folder This contains the info about each sample The colnames of colData should include ‘Population’, ‘Timepoint’, ‘Sex’ , ‘Dataset’ and ‘Species’ If your experiment does not separate those samples based on any of those parameters, you will need to create a column that specifies this. E.g. if your samples are of mixed sex, you can creates a ‘Sex’ column containing ‘mixed’ for all samples 2.2 Building an SQL database "],["ui.html", "Chapter 3 User Interface", " Chapter 3 User Interface "],["server.html", "Chapter 4 Server", " Chapter 4 Server "],["trouble.html", "Chapter 5 Troubleshooting", " Chapter 5 Troubleshooting "],["other.html", "Chapter 6 Other", " Chapter 6 Other "],["sharing-your-book.html", "Chapter 7 Sharing your book 7.1 Publishing 7.2 404 pages 7.3 Metadata for sharing", " Chapter 7 Sharing your book 7.1 Publishing HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html 7.2 404 pages By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.

You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
